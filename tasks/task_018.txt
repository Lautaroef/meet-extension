# Task ID: 18
# Title: Chrome Extension UI for 'Waiting Room Warm-Up'
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the UI component within the Chrome Extension to display the 'Waiting Room Warm-Up' summary. This should be a minimalistic and non-intrusive overlay on meeting platform waiting room screens (e.g., Google Meet, Zoom web).
# Details:
Use WXT content scripts to inject HTML/CSS into target meeting platform pages. Design a discreet UI (e.g., small, dismissible panel). Fetch summary data from an API endpoint (Task 19). Ensure adaptability to different platform UIs.

# Test Strategy:
Test UI injection and display on supported meeting platforms. Verify content is displayed correctly and UI is non-intrusive. Test responsiveness to page layout changes.
