# Task ID: 14
# Title: Scheduled Sync Process (Cron for Data Sources)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up a scheduled process (e.g., daily cron job using a service like Supabase Edge Functions, GitHub Actions, or a custom scheduler) to check for updates from connected data sources and trigger the sync and processing pipeline.
# Details:
Implement a function that iterates through users/data sources and fetches new/updated content. Trigger data processing (Task 12) and storage (Task 13). Configure cron expression for daily or configurable frequency. Handle concurrency and fault tolerance.

# Test Strategy:
Test the scheduler triggers correctly. Verify it fetches updates from mock data sources and processes them. Monitor logs for successful completion and error handling.
