# Status: pending

# Description: Implement user registration and login functionality in the Next.js web application using Supabase Authentication. This includes UI forms and backend logic.
# Details:
Use `supabase-js` library. Create signup and login pages/components in Next.js. Leverage `@21st-dev/magic` for form generation if suitable. Store user sessions securely. Implement password reset and email verification flows.

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration, login, logout, session persistence, and password reset functionality. Verify user data is correctly stored in Supabase `auth.users` table.
