# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 25
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop initial prompts for OpenAI models used in 'GEM' alert generation (for more advanced GEMs beyond keyword spotting) and the AI Chat interface. Focus on clarity, context-awareness, and generating actionable insights.
# Details:
For GEMs: Prompts to analyze transcript + user data for connections. For Chat: System prompts to define AI persona and capabilities. User prompts to include conversation history and relevant data snippets. Refer to OpenAI Cookbook for best practices.

# Test Strategy:
Iteratively test prompts with sample inputs. Evaluate AI responses for relevance, accuracy, and helpfulness. Refine prompts based on results.
