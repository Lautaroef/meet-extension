# Task ID: 8
# Title: Chrome Extension Basic Structure (WXT)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the basic structure for the Chrome Extension using WXT, including entry points for background scripts, content scripts, and popup/options UI if needed. Ensure inter-script communication mechanisms are understood.
# Details:
Define manifest entries in `wxt.config.ts` for background service worker, content scripts (targetting meeting platforms like Google Meet, Zoom web). Create basic HTML/TS files for any UI elements (e.g., popup). Plan for message passing between components (e.g., `wxt/storage`, `browser.runtime.sendMessage`).

# Test Strategy:
Load the extension in Chrome. Verify background script runs, content script injects into a test page, and basic message passing works.
