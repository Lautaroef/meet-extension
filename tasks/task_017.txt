# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement an automated email delivery system to send the 'Intelligent Pre-Flight Check' email to users ~10 minutes before their scheduled meetings. Integrate with an email service provider (e.g., SendGrid, Resend, or Supabase's built-in email).
# Details:
Trigger email sending based on Google Calendar event start times. Use an email sending service API. Create email templates (HTML/text) for the briefing. Ensure proper formatting and deliverability.

# Test Strategy:
Test email sending to mock recipients. Verify email content and formatting. Test scheduling logic to ensure emails are sent at the correct pre-meeting interval.
