# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the basic UI shell for the AI Assistant Drawer in the Chrome Extension. This drawer will house the 'Past GEMs' log and the AI chat interface.
# Details:
Create a collapsible/expandable drawer or sidebar UI injected into the meeting page. Use WXT for managing this UI component. It should be accessible via a toggle button. Structure for 'Past GEMs' list and chat input/output area.

# Test Strategy:
Test drawer opening/closing, layout, and responsiveness on target meeting platforms. Ensure it integrates smoothly with the page.
