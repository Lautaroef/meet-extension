# Task ID: 4
# Title: Configure Git Repository and Branching Strategy
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure the project's Git repository, confirm the project structure within the existing repo, and establish a clear branching strategy (e.g., main, develop, feature branches).
# Details:
Ensure `./live-meeting-assistant` is the root. Create `extension` and `webapp` subdirectories if not done by project setups. Define branching model (e.g., GitFlow variant). Set up `.gitignore` files for Node modules, build artifacts, and environment variables.

# Test Strategy:
Verify repository structure, `.gitignore` effectiveness, and successful creation/merging of a test feature branch.
