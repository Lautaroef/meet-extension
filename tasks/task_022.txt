# Task ID: 22
# Title: 'GEM' Alert UI Component (Chrome Ext)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement a non-intrusive UI component in the Chrome Extension to display 'GEM' alerts. Alerts should appear briefly (e.g., top-right) and then fade out.
# Details:
Create a UI element (e.g., a toast notification) using HTML/CSS/JS injected by a content script. Style it to be noticeable but not distracting. Implement fade-in/fade-out animations. Ensure it doesn't interfere with meeting platform controls.

# Test Strategy:
Test alert display on various meeting platforms. Verify visibility, timing, and non-intrusiveness. Test with multiple alerts appearing in succession.
