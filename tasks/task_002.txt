# Task ID: 2
# Title: Setup Next.js Project for Web Application
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Next.js project for the web application that will handle settings, data synchronization management, and user accounts. Configure TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
# Details:
Use `npx create-next-app@latest --typescript`. Integrate Tailwind CSS following official Next.js guide. Project directory: `./live-meeting-assistant/webapp`. Structure: `pages/`, `components/`, `lib/`.

# Test Strategy:
Verify successful project creation, that the dev server (`next dev`) runs, and Tailwind CSS utility classes are correctly applied.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new Next.js project with TypeScript support using create-next-app
### Details:
Run 'npx create-next-app --typescript example-app' to bootstrap a new Next.js project with TypeScript configuration. This will automatically install necessary dependencies and create the initial project structure with TypeScript support.
<info added on 2025-05-12T00:10:31.190Z>
Navigate to the `live-meeting-assistant` directory and run the following command to initialize the Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest webapp --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"
```

This command will:
1. Create a new Next.js application named `webapp` inside the `live-meeting-assistant` directory
2. Configure TypeScript for type safety
3. Set up Tailwind CSS for styling (note this will complete subtask 2.2)
4. Include ESLint for code quality
5. Use the App Router architecture
6. Create a `src` directory for better code organization
7. Configure import aliases to use "@/*" pattern

The final path to the web application will be `live-meeting-assistant/webapp`. The `create-next-app` tool will automatically handle directory creation and install all necessary dependencies.

## 2. Integrate Tailwind CSS [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Add and configure Tailwind CSS in the Next.js project
### Details:
Install Tailwind CSS dependencies with 'npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer', initialize Tailwind with 'npx tailwindcss init -p', configure content paths in tailwind.config.js, and add Tailwind directives to the global CSS file.
<info added on 2025-05-12T00:13:34.533Z>
Install Tailwind CSS dependencies with 'npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer', initialize Tailwind with 'npx tailwindcss init -p', configure content paths in tailwind.config.js, and add Tailwind directives to the global CSS file.

Using Next.js 15+ with Tailwind v4:
1. The `create-next-app --tailwind` command successfully installed Tailwind CSS v4 and @tailwindcss/postcss.
2. The postcss.config.mjs file is correctly configured to use @tailwindcss/postcss.
3. src/app/globals.css is properly set up with @import "tailwindcss"; for Tailwind v4 styles.
4. Tailwind v4 is designed for zero-config in common setups, so no separate tailwind.config.js or tailwind.config.ts file is created by default.
5. Content paths are automatically inferred by Tailwind v4.
6. If customization is needed later, a tailwind config file can be manually created.

The default Tailwind v4 integration via create-next-app is successful and ready for use in the project.

## 3. Set up directory structure [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Create and organize the project's folder structure following Next.js best practices
### Details:
Create folders for components, pages/routes, styles, utils, hooks, and types. Set up appropriate TypeScript configuration in tsconfig.json for path aliases and strict type checking. Create initial placeholder files in each directory to establish the structure.
<info added on 2025-05-12T00:14:22.475Z>
The project structure will be organized within the existing `live-meeting-assistant/webapp/src/` directory that was created by the `create-next-app` command. The following additional directories will be created inside the `src/` folder:

1. `components/` - For reusable UI components
2. `lib/` - For utilities, helpers, and shared functions
3. `hooks/` - For custom React hooks
4. `styles/` - For additional global styles beyond the default `src/app/globals.css`
5. `types/` - For TypeScript type definitions and interfaces

Each of these empty directories will include a `.gitkeep` file to ensure they are tracked by Git version control. The existing `src/app/` directory will be used for page routes following Next.js 13+ App Router conventions.

The `tsconfig.json` file will be verified to ensure it has proper path aliases (the `@/*` alias should be configured by default with create-next-app) and that strict type checking is enabled, which is typically the default setting in newer Next.js projects.

## 4. Verify dev server and Tailwind integration [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Start the development server and confirm TypeScript and Tailwind CSS are working correctly
### Details:
Run 'npm run dev' to start the development server. Create a test component with Tailwind classes to verify CSS is working. Check for TypeScript errors in the terminal and browser console. Make necessary adjustments to configuration files if issues are found.

Run 'npm run dev' to start the development server. Create a test component with Tailwind classes to verify CSS is working. Check for TypeScript errors in the terminal and browser console. Make necessary adjustments to configuration files if issues are found.

Verification Steps:
1. Add a test `div` with Tailwind classes to the main page:
   - Navigate to `live-meeting-assistant/webapp/src/app/page.tsx`
   - Add a div with classes: `p-4 bg-blue-500 text-white text-xl` and text "Hello Tailwind!"

2. Start the development server:
   - Open terminal and navigate to `live-meeting-assistant/webapp/` directory
   - Run `npm run dev` command

3. Manual Verification Process:
   - Open browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
   - Inspect browser console for any TypeScript errors
   - Check terminal output for any compilation errors
   - Verify the test div appears with:
     * Blue background (bg-blue-500)
     * White text (text-white)
     * Padding (p-4)
     * Larger text size (text-xl)

4. Document Results:
   - Note any errors encountered
   - Confirm successful Tailwind CSS integration
   - Record any configuration adjustments needed
