# Task ID: 13
# Title: Data Storage Logic (Processed Insights to Supabase via Prisma)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement logic to store the processed and summarized insights from the Data Processing Service into the Supabase database using Prisma. Ensure data is indexed for efficient retrieval.
# Details:
Use Prisma Client to write processed data to relevant Supabase tables (e.g., `SyncedItemInsights`). Ensure foreign key relationships (to users, original data sources) are maintained. Add database indexes on frequently queried columns (e.g., `user_id`, `created_at`, keywords).

# Test Strategy:
Verify data is correctly inserted/updated in Supabase. Test data retrieval performance with indexes. Ensure data integrity and relationships.
