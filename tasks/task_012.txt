# Task ID: 12
# Title: Data Processing Service (Summarization/Indexing with Gemini)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 9, 10, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a backend service/module (within Next.js or a separate Node.js service) to process synced data from various sources. Use Gemini API for summarizing large text contexts and structuring data for indexing.
# Details:
Input: Raw data from Notion, text files, etc. Output: Summarized and structured insights. Use Gemini API (e.g., `gemini-pro` model) for summarization and potentially for extracting key entities or topics. Define schema for processed data. Handle API rate limits and errors. See https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/structured-output.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test processing logic with sample data. Validate Gemini API integration and output quality. Test summarization of various content lengths and types.
