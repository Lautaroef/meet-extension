# Task ID: 19
# Title: API Endpoint for Pre-Meeting Summary (Next.js for Chrome Ext)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an API endpoint in the Next.js application that the Chrome Extension can call to fetch the pre-meeting summary content generated by Task 16.
# Details:
Develop a secure REST API endpoint (e.g., `/api/meetings/:meetingId/summary`). Authenticate requests from the Chrome extension (e.g., using user session token). Retrieve the relevant briefing data from Supabase.

# Test Strategy:
Test the API endpoint with valid and invalid requests. Verify authentication and correct data retrieval. Measure API response time.
