# Title: ElevenLabs 'Scribe' API Integration for Live Transcription
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate the ElevenLabs 'Scribe' API (or an alternative) into the Chrome Extension to capture live audio from the current meeting tab and transcribe it to text in real-time.
# Details:
Use `chrome.tabCapture` API to get audio stream from the active meeting tab. Send audio data to ElevenLabs Scribe API (https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/speech-to-text/convert) via WebSockets or HTTP streaming for real-time results. Handle API key management securely. Manage audio chunks and transcription segments.

# Test Strategy:
Test audio capture from a meeting tab. Verify real-time transcription accuracy and latency with ElevenLabs. Handle connection errors and API limits.
