# Task ID: 24
# Title: 'Past GEMs' Log Functionality (Drawer)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22, 23, 21
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the 'Past GEMs' log functionality within the AI Assistant Drawer. This will be a scrollable list displaying all 'GEM' alerts that have appeared during the current meeting.
# Details:
When a GEM alert is triggered (Task 21) and displayed (Task 22), also add its content to a list managed by the AI Assistant Drawer component. Ensure the list is scrollable and displays GEMs chronologically.

# Test Strategy:
Trigger multiple GEM alerts. Verify they are all logged in the 'Past GEMs' section in the correct order. Test scrolling and display of GEM content.
