# Task ID: 33
# Title: Expand Data Source Integration (e.g., Evernote or Hubspot)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7, 12, 13, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Expand data source integrations by adding support for one more service, e.g., Evernote or Hubspot, following the pattern established for Notion and Google Calendar.
# Details:
Choose one: Evernote (use Evernote Developer Docs: NoteStore.createNote, etc.) or Hubspot (use `hubspot/hubspot-api-nodejs`). Implement OAuth, data fetching, and add to the sync/processing pipeline (Tasks 12, 13, 14). Update Next.js UI (Task 7) to manage this new source.

# Test Strategy:
Test OAuth, data fetching, processing, and storage for the new data source. Verify it integrates into the pre-meeting briefing and GEM alert system.
